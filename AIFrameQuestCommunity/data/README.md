# Data Directory

This directory contains JSON files for storing application data:

- `users.json`: Stores user information (nickname and password)
- `image_metadata.json`: Stores metadata for images (filename as key with corresponding term/value)
- `comments.json`: Stores user comments and ratings for each image term

These files are used by the application to implement user authentication, image metadata display, and the comment/rating system.
